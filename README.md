- Java Solutions for the Neetcode.io practice problems.
- This repository includes different coding patterns, which have been separated out as Java packages.
  - For example, a program for "Two Pointers" pattern can be found in the package _com.pallamsetty.twopointers_
- Unit tests are used to test the solution for each problem with different inputs.
- In some cases, where I have attempted multiple solutions, I have used the same inputs for all the solutions.
- Further, I have added the corresponding Leetcode problem number for the same problem wherever possible.

- To skip to the particular pattern:
